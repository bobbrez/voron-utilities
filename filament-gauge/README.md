# Filament Gauge v1

A simple laser cut tool to quickly measure out and mark 100mm of filament from the entry into the extruder

## Key Points

- The gauge is oversized by 0.2mm to account for kerf when cutting 6mm acrylic
- 1.7mm filament channel is etched but may need to be calibrated for your material / cutter
- 8mm hole to hang nearby for quick access
- Additional Slot at 50mm

## Cutting

This was designed and cut with on a Glowforge Pro

## BOM

| Material           | Rounded Dimensions (mm) |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| 6mm (1/4") acrylic | 110mm x 30mm            |

## Usage

### Mark 100mm Reference

1. Place the bottom of the gauge flush with the entrypoint of the filament into the extruder
2. Lay the filament straight into the channel
3. Use an ultra-fine point Sharpie to mark 100mm from the entry

### Measure Remaining Filament

1. Place a small amount of painter's tape on the wide space near the bottom of the gauge
2. Lay the filament straight into the channel
3. Use an ultra-fine point Sharpie to mark on the tape where the reference mark is post-extruding
4. Use a set of calipers to measure the distance from the bottom of the gauge to the making on the tape
